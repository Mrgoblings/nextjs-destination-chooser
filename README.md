# Next.js Destination Chooser

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project named "Destination Chooser". The application allows users to choose their next travel destination from a list of options. It's bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This application is containerized using Docker, and orchestrated with Docker Compose. To get the application running, you only need Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mrgoblings/nextjs-destination-chooser
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd nextjs-destination-chooser
```

Then, use Docker Compose to build and start the application:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Project Structure

The main application code is in the `pages` directory, which contains all the page components for the Next.js application. The `components` directory contains reusable React components, and the `lib` directory contains utility functions and configurations.
