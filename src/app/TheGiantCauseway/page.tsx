                body="The Giant's Causeway lies at the foot of the basalt cliffs along the sea coast on the edge of the Antrim plateau in Northern Ireland. It's renowned for its unique geological formations. The most characteristic feature of this incredible UNESCO World Heritage site is the exposure of around 40,000 massive black hexagonal basalt columns, descending gently into the sea. Geological studies of these formations over the last 300 years show that this striking landscape was formed by volcanic activity during the Tertiary, around 50-60 million years ago."

                    Half a million years of volcanic activity deposits several lava flows (the Lower Basalts). Volcanism ceases for half a million years. This period of volcanic inactivity and weathering is followed by a new phase of volcanism. Molten rock rises to fill a magma chamber beneath the surface. Magma ascends to the surface and erupts as lava. The magma chamber deflates causing the ground above to subside and creating a hollow at the surface. The erupted lava then fills the hollow.

                    Legend has it that an Irish giant named Finn McCool created a causeway to get across the Irish Sea to face his rival, the Scottish giant Benandonner, who challenged Finn. Following their fearsome meeting, Benandonner ripped up the causeway as he fled back to Scotland, leaving what you see here today.

                    However, a little-known fable provides an alternative version of the story. This lesser-known story was told by Causeway guides in the 1700s and early 1800s â€“ of Finn building the Causeway for love rather than battle.
